        <h1>History of the Club</h1>
        <p>
            The club was founded in 1905, and quickly gained popularity among fans, but failed to win a single trophy in the first 50 years of its existence.
            Chelsea spent 30 of their first 40 seasons in the First Division, although they were often in the middle of the standings or even fought to retain their place in the First Division.
            Chelsea's very first success came in the FA Cup, finishing second in 1915 and losing semi-finals in 1911, 1920, 1932, 1950, and 1952.
            The series of failures was finally destroyed by manager Ted Drake, who made a number of changes to the structure of the club and led Chelsea to the first championship in the 1954/55 season.
